# Engine2d

This is my first game engine, written around the libgdx library.
Currently only working on Android!

Use the AIDE ide app for Android to open and compile the project. 


###FOR LATER...ONLY I KNOW WHY
To convert pixel space to percent of resolution:
convert percent of numeric value. Example:
40% of 1080 translates to: 40% / 100 = 0.40(1080) = 432

This formula will be used to calculate percents allowing for easier calculation when resizing the engine graphiclly.
